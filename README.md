# Data supporting findings

This repository contains two `Excel files` with data of [Force](/Force) and data of [step-length/step-frequency](Spatiotemporal_Variables) obtained in running, as part of the study entitled **"Running against inertia,
 friction, gravity: different modalities, same consequences on propulsive force capacities"**

## Study summary: 
The present study focused on **force production capacities dedicated to locomotion**. In the animal kingdom, locomotion capacities are 
determinant to find food, to reproduce, or escape a predator (among others). In mountain particularly, the locomotion capacities are 
influenced by environmental factors as the hill gradient. To facilitate the investigation of propulsive force capacities in such 
environment, the present study aimed at testing whether a mechanical analogy does exist among level accelerated sprint, steady velocity 
resisted and steady velocity uphill running. For ease of study, this was tested in human.


The main outcome is that **force capacities** measured during an acceleration on the level, and during steady velocity resisted and uphill 
running **are similar**, provided comparisons are performed at similar velocities. No differences in step length-velocity and 
frequency-velocity relationships were found between accelerated, loaded, and uphill running modalities.


The validation of such a mechanical analogy is of main interest to further understand the interactions between animals’ locomotion 
capacities and the mountain environment (i.e., graded terrain). It also offers a wide panels of testing modalities (e.g., to investigate 
fatigability in trail runners or adapt training modalities).

## Files overview: 

Two sheets are provided: 

[🏃 Force data](/Force) 

**"Running_Force_Velocity.csv"** contains data of force, calculated with an inverse dynamic approach applied to the centre of mass, 
and velocity data measured with a radar device (📡 46.875 Hz, ATS Pro II, Stalker, Texas, USA)



## [🏃 Spatiotemporal variales data](/Spatiotemporal_Variables) 

**"Running_Step_Length_Frequency.csv"** contains data of running kinematics (Step Frequency and step length), obtained with an 
accelerometer (🔧 1000 Hz, MuscleBan, Plux Biosignals, Lisbon, Portugal) 

> **Note:** The force and kinematics variables are organised according with the condition in which it was obtain and associated to the participant number. One should note that the colour code (dark or light blue and yellow) matches the colour code of the figures presented in the associated paper, for ease of read.
